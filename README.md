Handling Outliers in Data Analysis

## Overview
Outliers are data points that significantly differ from the rest of the dataset. They can skew and mislead the results of data analysis, especially when using statistical methods that are sensitive to abnormal data. Handling outliers is a crucial step in preparing data for analysis to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.

This repository provides a detailed guide on detecting and handling outliers using Python, including various methods and techniques for both visualizing and mitigating the effects of outliers.

## What to Learn:
Understanding Outliers: Learn what outliers are and why they matter in data analysis.
Detecting Outliers: Explore various methods to identify outliers, including visual and statistical techniques.
Handling Outliers: Learn different strategies to handle outliers, such as removal, transformation, capping, and imputation.

## What are Outliers?
Outliers are data points that differ significantly from other observations in a dataset. They may be unusually high or low and can arise due to variability in the data, measurement errors, or other anomalies. Outliers can have a significant impact on statistical analyses and models, leading to misleading results.

## Types of Outliers
**1. Univariate Outliers:**
   These are outliers in a single variable. They can be identified by looking at the distribution of the data in that variable.
   
**2. Multivariate Outliers:**
These are outliers that occur in a combination of two or more variables. They may not be evident when looking at each variable individually but become apparent when considering the relationships between variables.

## Detecting Outliers
**1. Visual Methods:**
  - Box Plot: A box plot shows the distribution of data and can help identify outliers, which are typically marked as points outside the "whiskers" of the plot.
  + Scatter Plot: Useful for detecting outliers in bivariate data.
  * Histogram: Can show the distribution of data and reveal any unusual spikes or gaps.
**2. Statistical Methods:**
  - Z-Score: Measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. Data points with a Z-score greater than a certain threshold (commonly 3 or -3) are considered outliers.
  +  Interquartile Range (IQR): The IQR is the range between the 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3). Outliers are typically defined as points that lie below Q1 - 1.5IQR or above Q3 + 1.5IQR.

## Overcoming Outliers
  1. Removing Outliers: This is the simplest method where outliers are removed from the dataset. This should be done carefully, as removing data points can bias the analysis.
  2. Transforming Data: Applying transformations like log or square root can reduce the impact of outliers.
  3. Imputing Outliers: Replace outliers with a more central value (like the mean or median). This can help reduce the impact of outliers without removing them from the dataset.
  4. Using Robust Statistical Methods: Some statistical techniques are less sensitive to outliers, such as median-based measures or algorithms like Random Forests.
